**Erdős Problem 829 (open).**  Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be the set of perfect cubes.  Is
it true that $(1_A \ast 1_A)(n) \ll (\log n)^{O(1)}$?  That is, does there exist a natural
number $C$ such that the number of representations of $n$ as a sum of two cubes is
$O((\log n)^C)$ as $n \to \infty$?
