A355228: $a(n)$ is the smallest integer $m$ such that there exist $n$ of its distinct divisors $(d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n)$ with the property that $m = d_1 + d_2 + \dots + d_n = \operatorname{lcm}(d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n)$, or 0 if no such number $m$ exists.

A355228 a(n) >= A081512(n) because in A081512, it is not required that m = lcm(d_1, d_2, ..., d_n).
Currently, the strict inequality happens for n = 4 and n = 5; are there other such cases?

This conjecture states that the set of natural numbers $n$ for which the strict inequality $a(n) > a_081512(n)$ holds is exactly $\{4, 5\}$.
