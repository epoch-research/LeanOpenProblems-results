A275678: Number of ordered ways to write $n$ as $4^k(1+4x^2+y^2) + z^2$,
where $k,x,y,z$ are nonnegative integers with $x \le y$.

/-- Conjecture: Any positive integer can be written as $4^k(1+4x^2+y^2) + z^2$,
where $k,x,y,z$ are nonnegative integers with $x \le z$.
Note: This is part (ii) of the conjecture listed in OEIS A275678.
This is a different conjecture because the constraint $x \le y$ in the definition of $a(n)$
is replaced by $x \le z$ here, and the problem is about existence (similar to (i)), not number of ways.
The question only asked to formalize "oeis_275678_conjecture_1", which I take to be the primary one (i),
but I will include (ii) as well for completeness, as it's a nearby mathematical claim.
