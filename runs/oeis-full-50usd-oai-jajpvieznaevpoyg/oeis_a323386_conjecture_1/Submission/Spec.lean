Conjecture 1: This sequence consists only of 1's and primes.
Conjecture 2: Every odd prime of the form $\lfloor \sqrt{2} \cdot m \rfloor$ is a term of this sequence.
Conjecture 3: At the first appearance of each prime of the form $\lfloor \sqrt{2} \cdot m \rfloor$, it is the next prime after the largest prime that has already appeared.
