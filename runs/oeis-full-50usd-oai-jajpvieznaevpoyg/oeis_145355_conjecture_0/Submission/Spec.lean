A145355: $a(n) = \mathrm{round}(\mathrm{round}(\sqrt{n!})/|(\mathrm{round}(\sqrt{n!}))^2 - n!|)$.
The provided sequence starts at $n=2$. The definition works for $n=0, 1$ as well, provided we accept the behavior of $\mathbb{R}$ division by zero, which in Mathlib is typically $0$ but the result is not significant since the sequence is defined for $n \ge 2$ where the denominator is nonzero.

oeis_145355_conjecture_0: This sequence suggests that the distance between a factorial and the closest power is tightly bounded.

Formalization: The sequence $a(n)$ is bounded.
This is the most direct mathematical interpretation of the data provided for $a(n)$.
