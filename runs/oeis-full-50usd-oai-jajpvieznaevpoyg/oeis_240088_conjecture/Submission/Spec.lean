The number of ways of writing $n$ as an ordered sum of a triangular number (A000217), a square (A000290) and a pentagonal number (A000326).
$$a(n) = \#\{(i, j, k) \in \mathbb{N}^3 \mid T_i + S_j + P_k = n\}$$
where $T_i = i(i+1)/2$, $S_j=j^2$, and $P_k=k(3k-1)/2$.

It is conjectured that a(n) is always positive.
This means that every natural number $n$ can be written as an ordered sum of a triangular number, a square, and a pentagonal number.
