A067857: Sum_{k|n} a(k)/k! = Sum_{j=1 to n} 1/j, sum on left is over positive divisors k of n.
The formula for $a(n)$ derived from Möbius inversion is
$$a(n) = n! \sum_{d \mid n} \mu(n/d) H_d$$
where $H_d = \sum_{j=1}^d \frac{1}{j}$ is the $d$-th Harmonic Number (`harmonic d` in Mathlib), and $\mu$ is the Möbius function (`ArithmeticFunction.moebius`).
The sequence members are integers (the first negative one is $a(30)$), but the definition is most naturally computed in $\mathbb{Q}$. We define the result as a rational number.

The terms are not all positive.  The first negative one is a(30) = -22690644647302814715858124800000.
Conjecture: a(n) < 0 if and only if A001221(n) is an odd number >= 3.
A001221(n) is $\Omega(n)$, the total number of prime factors of $n$ (counted with multiplicity), which is `ArithmeticFunction.cardFactors n`.
