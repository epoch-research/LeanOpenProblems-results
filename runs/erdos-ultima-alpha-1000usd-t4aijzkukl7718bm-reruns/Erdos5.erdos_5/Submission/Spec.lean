The normalised prime gap $\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{\log n}$, where $p_n$ denotes the $n$-th prime.

/--
The set $S$ of limit points of $\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{\log n}$.

Only the *finite* limit points are collected here; that $\infty$ is also a limit point is
Westzynthius' theorem, recorded separately as `erdos_5.variants.westzynthius`.

Erdős' question, as well as [HiMa88] and [Pi16], normalises the prime gaps by $\log n$, whereas
[GPY09], [BFM16] and [Me20] normalise by $\log p_n$. Since $\log p_n/\log n \to 1$ the two
normalisations have the same limit points, so all the results below are stated for the
normalisation used here.

/--
Let $C\geq 0$. Is there an infinite sequence of $n_i$ such that
$$\lim_{i\to \infty}\frac{p_{n_i+1}-p_{n_i}}{\log n_i}=C?$$

We formalise "an infinite sequence of $n_i$" as a strictly monotone sequence of indices
`n : ℕ → ℕ`. Note that the numerator is the gap between the two *consecutive* primes
$p_{n_i}$ and $p_{n_i+1}$, which is `primeGap (n i)`, and not the gap between the primes
indexed by two consecutive members of the sequence.
