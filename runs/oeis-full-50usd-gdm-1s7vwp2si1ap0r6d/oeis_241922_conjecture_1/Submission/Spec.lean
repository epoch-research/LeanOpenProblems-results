The OEIS sequence A241922: Smallest $k^2 \ge 0$ such that $n-k^2$ is semiprime, or $a(n)=2$ if there is no such $k^2$.
A number $m$ is semiprime if $\Omega(m)=2$, where $\Omega(m)$ is the number of prime factors of $m$ counted with multiplicity.

    if m ≤ 1 then 0
    else (Nat.factorization m).sum (fun _ k => k)

The Goldbach binary conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.
