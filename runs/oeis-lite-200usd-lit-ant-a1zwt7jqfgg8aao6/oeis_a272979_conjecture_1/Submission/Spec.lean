Conjecture: For positive integers a,b,c,d, any natural number can be written as
a*x^2 + b*y^2 + c*z^3 + d*w^4 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers, if and only if (a,b,c,d)
is among the following 49 quadruples: (1,2,1,1), (1,3,1,1), (1,6,1,1), (2,3,1,1), (2,4,1,1),

/-- The conjecture is false: `full_representability` is symmetric under swapping the
first two coefficients (relabelling the two square variables), whereas the conjectured
set `a272979_magic_quadruples` is normalized to `a ≤ b` and hence not closed under this
symmetry. For instance `(1,2,1,1)` lies in the set but its swap `(2,1,1,1)` does not,
even though the two forms represent exactly the same set of natural numbers. -/
