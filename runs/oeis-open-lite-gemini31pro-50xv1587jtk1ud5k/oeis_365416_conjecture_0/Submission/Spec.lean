/--
Predicate for a number to be a prime power with exponent strictly greater than 1.
This is equivalent to being a composite prime power (a perfect power whose base is prime).

  ∃ (p e : ℕ), Nat.Prime p ∧ 1 < e ∧ p ^ e = m

/--
A365416 According to Pillai's conjecture, k = 13 is the only term such that 2*k-1 and 2*k+1 both have exponent greater than 1.
